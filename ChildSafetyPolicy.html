🔒 Child Safety Policy – SerendipiApp
Effective Date: June 2, 2025
Last Updated: June 2, 2025

At SerendipiApp, we are committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all users. As part of our responsibility, we actively work to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on our platform and comply fully with Google Play's child safety standards.

👮‍♀️ Our Commitment to Child Safety
No minors allowed: SerendipiApp is strictly for users aged 18 and older. We do not permit registration or access by minors under any circumstances.

User verification: We use mechanisms to verify age and may request additional information when needed.

Proactive moderation: Our team monitors and moderates all reported content. We use a combination of automated tools and human review to detect and remove harmful material.

🚫 Zero Tolerance for CSAE
We strictly prohibit any content, communication, or behavior that involves, suggests, or promotes child sexual abuse or exploitation.

Any user who violates these standards will be permanently banned and reported to relevant law enforcement or regulatory agencies.

We cooperate with organizations like NCMEC (National Center for Missing & Exploited Children) when required by law.

🧑‍💼 Reporting Concerns
Users can report inappropriate content or behavior directly in the app using the report function available in every profile and chat.

If you believe someone is violating our child safety policy, you can also contact us directly:

📜 Law Enforcement Cooperation
We comply with all applicable laws and will provide data to authorized agencies when required through legal channels.

🧠 Education & Awareness
We provide in-app reminders and links to educational resources to help users recognize and report abusive behavior.

This policy is publicly available and reviewed regularly. We are committed to continuous improvement and transparency in our safety practices.
